Hi there üëãüèª, I‚Äôm Qianjie WEI È≠èÂÄ©Ê¥Å.

I‚Äôm a second-year MPhil student in [the Computational Media and Arts Thrust](https://cma.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Mingming Fan](https://www.mingmingfan.com/) and Prof. [Yi Cai](https://sites.google.com/view/hkust-gz-yicai/home?authuser=0). I‚Äôm also a member of [the Accessible & Pervasive User Experience (APEX) Lab](https://www.mingmingfan.com/lab/).

My research interest lies in Human-Computer Interaction, Virtual Reality, Accessibility, and Human-AI collaboration.

Previously, I received a B.E. degree in industrial design from [the College of Design and Innovation](https://tjdi.tongji.edu.cn/) at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/).
